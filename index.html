            <p>Hello, My name is Eastern Lai.  This isn't my first website, I've
                taken more beginner online courses about html and css than I 
                care to count.  But this is my for foray into learning how to 
                code and build websites in a more structured manner with a goal
                in sight.
            </p>
            <p>At the end of this course I hope to be a proficient coder with
                the capcity to build on that skill set with the end goal of:
                <ol>
                    <li>1. Being a viable candidate for companies willing to grow talent.</li>
                    <li>2. Incorporate my newfound knowledge of coding with my existing IT skillsets.</li>
                    <li>3. Becoming a freelance developer taking on projects for mom and pops.</li> 
                </ol>
            </p>
            <p>Which ever path I choose, I hope to be successful.</p>
